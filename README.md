# 📦 Assault Cube [INFINITE HEALTH]

**Second C++ Project:** This is the second project i have ever created in C++, so dont expect much from it!

**How does it work?**
This program writes new a health value in a loop to make the unlimited health effect for the Assault Cube game.

# ⚒️ Setup

- **1:** Make a folder with the files provided.
- **2:** Open the "Assault Cube Health.sln" in VSCode.
- **3:** Build the file in "x64 Release" and launch it while Assault Cube is open.

# 👤 Usage

**Do NOT use in multiplayer.**
Please do not use this in multiplayer and ruin the game for others.
This was made to educate myself in C++ and hopefully it helps someone else aswell.
Feel free to use this in whatever way you want, as long as it does not negatively affect other users.
